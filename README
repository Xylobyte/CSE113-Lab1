Lab 1

Purpose: Calculates values based on geometric measurements given by input from the user.

Conclusion:
    What I learned from this lab:
    I learned how to implement multiple functions to solve a given problem. It is convenient and efficient to only task functions with one task
    and return the value. This way a program can utilize mutliple functions efficiently and this encourages cleaner code overall.

    How did the pair programming help/hinder this lab?:
    The pair programming helped me with this lab because it prepared me to utilize functions correctly. It let my partner and I see things in
    our own way and ask eachother any questions we had. We reviewed eachothers' code after completeing the lab and discussed any issues we ran
    into and how we sovled them.

    Issues I had:
    I didn't have any issues in terms of compiling or writing my program.

    Improvements that can be made:
    I think I can improve my program by simplifying the way I ask for input and communicate to the user. Instead of a giant wall of text I could
    break it into functions.
